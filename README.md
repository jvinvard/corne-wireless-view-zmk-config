## Custom Colemak layout for Canadian French

This is a first for me in many area
- First Github project
- First Time really using VS Code
- First Split Keyboard
- First time trying Colemak
- First Layout
- First time ZMK

You see the pattern. I have an interest in custom keyboard since 2020.
I began to have pain in my right elbow and both wrist and started a quest to find better tools for my job.
Switching mouse often from my MX Master 2S and MX Vertical, slimmer keyboard etc.
I've finally find some split keyboard youtuber that helped me find my way for a first plunge into split keyboard.

My config is made to take into account that I have to write in french with the accent and all so I've incorporated 
almost all keys from a canadian french layout. Since I'm trying to learn Colemak I put it as my main layout.
You have a total of 9 layers. Colemak and Qwerty can be both switch on/off with a combo of the two last key on the right tumb
cluster. Both layers shares a lower and raised layout. Then you have specialized layer for; Bluetooth profiles, Navigation,
Numpad, Gaming. With another combo on the left tumb cluster you can go to a layer that is a hub for all specialized layers.
I also added one macro for now that is a shortcut for CTRL+ALT+DEL.
